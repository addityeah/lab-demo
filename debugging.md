# Comprehensive Pintos Debugging Guide
## Method 1: Printf Debugging

Printf debugging is the simplest and most commonly used debugging technique in Pintos.

### How Printf Works in Pintos

- Printf in Pintos is implemented to work almost regardless of what locks are held
- It's safe to use even in interrupt handlers and kernel panic situations
- Output goes directly to the console, making it reliable for debugging

### Printf Debugging Strategy

1. **Sprinkle printf statements** throughout suspicious code sections
2. **Use distinctive markers** like `"1. "`, `"2. "`, etc.
3. **Narrow down the problem area** systematically

### Debugging Our Echo Bug with Printf

```c
int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  int i;

  for (i = 0; i <= argc; i++){
    printf("1. before %dth printf", i);
    printf ("%s \n", argv[i]);
    printf("2. <%d>\n", i);
    printf("%d", 1/0);
  }
  printf ("\n");
  printf("3. Finished\n");

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

### Printf Analysis

- The first printf shows the argument index and its value.
- The second printf confirms the statement has been executed.
- The third printf indicates the end of the for loop.

### Printf Best Practices

- **Use unique identifiers** for each printf
- **Include variable values** in your debug output
- **Check boundaries** and assumptions
- **Remove debug printfs** after fixing the bug

## Method 2: Backtrace Debugging

Backtraces show the call stack when a kernel panic occurs, helping identify where and how the crash happened.

### Understanding Backtraces

A backtrace shows:
- The sequence of function calls leading to the crash
- File names and line numbers
- Memory addresses of each function call

### Example Backtrace from Our Bug

```
Call stack: 0xc0106eff 0xc01102fb 0xc010dc22 0xc010cf67 0xc0102319 0xc010325a 0x804812c 0x8048a96 0x8048ac8
```

### Using the Backtrace Tool

1. **Copy the backtrace** from the kernel panic message
2. **Run the backtrace command**:
   ```bash
   backtrace kernel.o 0xc0106eff 0xc01102fb 0xc010dc22 0xc010cf67 0xc0102319 0xc010325a 0x804812c 0x8048a96 0x8048ac8
   ```



## Method 3: GDB Debugging

GDB provides the most powerful debugging capabilities, allowing interactive debugging, breakpoints, and memory inspection.

### Setting Up GDB with Pintos

1. **Start Pintos with GDB support**:
   ```bash
   pintos --gdb -- run "echo long argument that does nothing"
   ```

2. **Connect GDB in another terminal**:
   ```bash
   cd pintos/src/userprog/build
   pintos-gdb kernel.o
   ```

3. **Attach to the remote target**:
   ```
   (gdb) debugpintos
   ```

### Essential GDB Commands for Debugging

#### Basic Navigation
- `c` (continue) - Resume execution
- `s` (step) - Execute one line, step into functions
- `n` (next) - Execute one line, step over functions
- `si` (step instruction) - Execute one machine instruction

#### Breakpoints
- `b function_name` - Set breakpoint at function
- `b file.c:line` - Set breakpoint at specific line
- `b *0x address` - Set breakpoint at memory address

#### Inspection
- `p variable` - Print variable value
- `p/x variable` - Print in hexadecimal
- `x/10wx $esp` - Examine 10 words at stack pointer
- `bt` - Show backtrace
- `info registers` - Show CPU registers

## Best Practices

### General Debugging Workflow

1. **Reproduce the bug consistently**
2. **Start with printf debugging** for initial investigation
3. **Use backtraces** to identify crash locations
4. **Use GDB** for detailed analysis and variable inspection
5. **Fix incrementally** and test after each change

### Printf Guidelines
- Use distinctive markers
- Include relevant variable values
- Remove debug code after fixing
- Be careful with printf in interrupt contexts

### GDB Guidelines
- Set meaningful breakpoints
- Inspect variables and memory systematically
- Use step-by-step execution for complex bugs
- Save GDB sessions for complex debugging

### Backtrace Guidelines
- Always save the full backtrace output
- Cross-reference with source code
- Look for patterns in recurring crashes
- Check for stack corruption signs

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Leaving debug printf in production code**
2. **Not checking printf output before locks are initialized**
3. **Assuming backtraces are always accurate with optimized code**
4. **Not considering compiler optimizations in GDB sessions**
5. **Forgetting to load user symbols when debugging user programs**

## Conclusion

Effective debugging in Pintos requires mastering all three techniques:

- **Printf debugging** for quick problem isolation
- **Backtraces** for understanding crash contexts
- **GDB** for detailed analysis and interactive debugging
